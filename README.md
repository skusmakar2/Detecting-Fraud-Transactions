# Detecting-Fraud-Transactions
## Overview
Throughout the financial sector, machine learning (ML) and analytics can play a vital role. This project shows an application of ML in detecting fraudulent customer transactions, based on their historical data. The project focuses on developing a data-driven approach for developing a ML solution and finding the best modelling approach suited to the problem. 

## Data
The dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud. The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions. It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. 

## Analysis and Modelling
Performed the EDA, data processing, and feature engineering using the imposed data measures. Different classification models were then tested for example, Loggistic regression, Bagging and boosting algorithms. Appropriate matrices such as Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), Area Under the receiver operator characterisitc curve (ROC-AUC), F1-score etc. were used to assess the performance of the models.
